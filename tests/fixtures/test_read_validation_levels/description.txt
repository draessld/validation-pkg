Test Read Validation Levels
============================

This fixture set tests the multi-level validation modes (strict, trust, minimal) for ReadValidator.

Files:
------

Correct Files:
- correct.fastq: Valid FASTQ file with 4 reads, proper format
- correct.fastq.gz: Gzip compressed version of correct.fastq
- correct.fastq.bz2: Bzip2 compressed version of correct.fastq

Damaged Files (for testing error detection):
- damaged_wrong_line_count.fastq: Has 6 lines (not divisible by 4)
- damaged_wrong_line_count.fastq.gz: Compressed version
- damaged_wrong_first_line.fastq: First line missing @ symbol
- damaged_wrong_separator.fastq: Separator line uses - instead of +
- damaged_length_mismatch.fastq: Sequence and quality lengths don't match

Expected Behavior:
------------------

validation_level='strict':
  - correct.fastq: PASS - full parsing and validation
  - damaged_*: FAIL - should detect all errors

validation_level='trust':
  - correct.fastq: PASS - check line count (16 lines, 16%4=0) and first record
  - damaged_wrong_line_count.fastq: FAIL - line count not divisible by 4
  - damaged_wrong_first_line.fastq: FAIL - first line doesn't start with @
  - damaged_wrong_separator.fastq: FAIL - third line doesn't start with +
  - damaged_length_mismatch.fastq: FAIL - sequence/quality length mismatch in first record

validation_level='minimal':
  - All files: PASS - no validation, just copy to output
